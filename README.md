## MongoDB 🌿

![MongoDB](./frontend/src/assets/mongoDBBanner.png)

- MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

### What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL ? 🤷‍♀️

- SQL databases are used to store structured data while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are used to save unstructured data. MongoDB is used to save unstructured data in JSON format. MongoDB does not support advanced analytics and joins like SQL databases support.

- In comparison to the SQL server, **MongoDB is faster and more scalable.**
